Hi, my name is Jochen Kirst√§tter, also known as "JoKi". I'm a [software craftsman](https://github.com/jochenkirstaetter), [blogger](https://jochen.kirstaetter.name/blog/), [community founder](https://jochen.kirstaetter.name/mscc/), and [speaker](https://jochen.kirstaetter.name/speaking/). Reach to [@JKirstaetter](https://twitter.com/jkirstaetter) on Twitter.

I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
